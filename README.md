#Android Design Patterns and Best Practice
This is the code repository for [Android Design Patterns and Best Practice](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/android-design-patterns-and-best-practice?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786467218), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Are you an Android developer with some experience under your belt? Are you wondering how the experts create efficient and good-looking apps? Then your wait will end with this book! We will teach you about different Android development patterns that will enable you to write clean code and make your app stand out from the crowd.


##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
Sequence prime = (Sequence) SequenceCache.getSequence("1");
primeText.setText(new StringBuilder()
    .append(getString(R.string.prime_text))
    .append(prime.getResult())
    .toString());
```

The chapters, 11, 12 and 13, themselves contain instructions for executing code and do not deal with code heavy topics.
Android Studio and SDK are both open source and can be installed from a single package. With one minor exception, which is outlined thoroughly in the relevant chapter, this is all the software required for this book.
